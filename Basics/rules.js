/* 1. Always consider the worst case for time complexity
   2. Remove constants
      O(n+50 ) = O(n)
   3. Different terms for different inputs
      If there are 2 inputs , consider separate terms for them
      O(n+m) is right not  O(n+n) or O(2n)
   4. Drop non dominant terms
      O(n+n^2) = O(n^2)

/*
Nested loops are O(n*n) = O(n^2)

f(n) could be :
1. linear : f(n) = n
2. quadratic : n*2
3. constant : 1
4. something else 

Things to learn for Data Structures
1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Traversal
4. Searching
5. Sorting
6. Access
